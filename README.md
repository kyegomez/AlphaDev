# AlphaDev Sorting Algorithm

## Overview

AlphaDev is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses reinforcement learning to discover enhanced computer science algorithms. AlphaDev was trained to uncover new algorithms by transforming sorting into a single-player ‘assembly game’. This repository provides the implementation of the sorting algorithms discovered by AlphaDev in the C++ language.

## Architecture

This repository contains the following main components:
1. `alpha_sort.hpp`: C++ header file containing the AlphaDev sorting algorithm
2. `alpha_sort.cpp`: C++ source file containing the AlphaDev sorting algorithm
3. `alpha_sort_test.cpp`: C++ test file to test the correctness and performance of the AlphaDev sorting algorithm
4. `CMakeLists.txt`: File for building the project using CMake.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AlphaDev-Sorting-Algorithm.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AlphaDev-Sorting-Algorithm`
3. Build the project: `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make`
4. Run the tests: `./AlphaDev_Sort_Test`

## Roadmap

### Stage 1: Reverse-Engineering AlphaDev Algorithms
Reverse-engineer the discovered algorithms and translate them into C++. 

### Stage 2: Implementing and Testing
Implement and test the algorithms in a high-level language such as C++. 

### Stage 3: Performance Evaluation
Carry out performance evaluation and optimization to ensure efficiency in different scenarios.

### Stage 4: Open-Sourcing
Make the implemented algorithms available in an open-source library for usage by developers worldwide.

### Stage 5: Expansion to Other Algorithms
After sorting, the approach will be expanded to improve other fundamental algorithms like hashing.
