# AlphaDev

## Introduction

AlphaDev is an AI model based on the AlphaZero/MuZero Reinforcement Learning architecture. It's designed to optimize assembly code using a set of assembly instructions and a cost function which takes into account both correctness and performance.

## Architecture

AlphaDev consists of:

1. Representation Network: `f_rep` that outputs a latent representation `ht` of the state `St`.

2. Prediction Network: `f_pred` that predicts the expected return (the value) `vˆt` and a policy `πˆt` from a given latent state.

3. Dynamics Network: `f_dyn` that predicts the next latent state `htk+1` and reward `rˆtk+1` resulting from a transition.

## How AlphaDev Works

On reaching a new state, AlphaDev encodes the state into a latent representation using the representation network. The dynamics and prediction networks are used to simulate several trajectories that fill out a search tree by sampling state transitions.

The actions are selected using a strategy that balances exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (progressing further down the subtree of the current best action).

Finally, the predicted policy is trained to match the visit counts of the MCTS policy in an attempt to distil the search procedure into a policy that will disregard nodes that are not promising.

## Potential Use Cases

AlphaDev, due to its general architecture, could potentially be adapted to solve a wide variety of optimization problems. Here are a few examples:

1. **Route Optimization**: For logistics companies, optimizing the routes of their fleet can result in significant cost savings. AlphaDev could be used to learn the optimal routes based on a variety of factors such as traffic, distance, and number of stops.

2. **Job Scheduling**: In computing, job scheduling is a key issue. AlphaDev could be used to learn the optimal schedule that maximizes the usage of computational resources and minimizes job completion time.

3. **Stock Portfolio Optimization**: AlphaDev could be used to learn the optimal mix of stocks to maximize return and minimize risk, given the current market conditions.

4. **Game Playing**: Similar to its ancestor AlphaZero, AlphaDev could potentially be used to master a wide variety of games, by learning the optimal strategies.

5. **Drug Discovery**: AlphaDev could be used to find the optimal chemical structure for a new drug that maximizes efficacy and minimizes side effects.

## Prerequisites

- Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) v.3 or higher
- TPU v.4 for the actor side

## Training

Train AlphaDev using a batch size of 1,024 per TPU core, with up to 16 TPU cores, for 1 million iterations.

## Usage

The AlphaDev model can be used to optimize assembly code or other optimization problems by implementing the model and specifying the proper cost function and action space.

## Future Work

Future adaptations of AlphaDev could implement different learning algorithms or optimization techniques for specific domains or problem areas.
